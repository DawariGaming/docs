# Form Builder by Webhook.site

Form Builder is an easy way to create HTML forms with custom functionality for Web sites, like contact forms, registration forms, etc.

Simply drag and drop the desired components onto the form, enter your Webhook.site URL and copy the HTML code to your Web site editor. 

<div class="center">
<a href="https://webhook.site/form-builder" class="md-button md-button--default no-underline center">Go to Webhook.site Form Builder</a>
</div>

Below is a quick video demo that shows how to use Form Builder to create a flow that emails recipients a generated PDF file using [Custom Actions](/custom-actions.html).
